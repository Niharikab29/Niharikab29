### Hi

I am a Product Manager, currently building AI systems to explore their real-world impact, limitations, and leverage.

Right now:
- Prototyping autonomous content workflows and AI agents
- Building from scratch to test, break, and learn faster  
- Deep-diving into AI and LLMs, using emerging tools, and staying current with tech and startup trends

Working with tools like:  
n8n, LangChain, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Bolt, Pinecone, Replicate, Cloudflare Workers, OpenRouter, etc.

More soon,  
Niharika
