### Hi

I am a Product Manager, currently building AI systems solo to understand their real-world impact, limitations, and highest-leverage use cases.

Right now:
- Designing and prototyping autonomous content workflows and AI agents  
- Thinking through random everyday problems â€“ through conversations, observation, and systems design  
- Building from scratch to test, break, and learn faster  
- Deep-diving into AI and LLMs, using emerging tools, and staying current with tech and startup trends

Working with tools like:  
n8n, LangChain, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Bolt, Pinecone, Replicate, Cloudflare Workers, OpenRouter, etc.

Always excited about jamming on solutions to complex problems

More soon,  
Niharika
